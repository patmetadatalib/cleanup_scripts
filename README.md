# cleanup_scripts

This repository has general cleanup and management scripts that were developed to deal with local metadata issues at Polk Library but which seemed like they might be useful to a broader library audience or to anybody. I have learned Python recently so I don't pretend to be a great coder, but I am happy to share anything that might help others.
